### Noteable Modifications:

	1. Maximum Height of code blocks has been eliminated to get rid of unnecessary additional scroll bars.
	2. Background colors have been eliminated due to the poor appearance they create.
	3. Line heights were increased to generate maximum readability.
	4. The background and typography for the language class has been adjusted to create a better design appearance.
